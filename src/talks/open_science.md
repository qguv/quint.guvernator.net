presented 13 Oct. 2015

## What/Why

Scientific work done for "public good" ought to be accessible to the public.

  - state-funded work now benefits citizens/entrepreneurs/organizations equally
  - work of "blue sky" research teams becomes more available to other teams
  - [Petition to US Gov't: "free access â€¦ to scientific journal articles â€¦ from taxpayer-funded research"](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/require-free-access-over-internet-scientific-journal-articles-arising-taxpayer-funded)
  - [US Response: "Expanding Public Access to the Results of Federally Funded Research"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/02/22/expanding-public-access-results-federally-funded-research)
  - [EU Consultation on Science 2.0](http://ec.europa.eu/research/consultations/science-2.0/consultation_en.htm)

## Different types of open science

Open Science functions as an <abbr title="buzzword">umbrella term</abbr> for one or many of the following:

  - open publishing/access: anyone can access the paper resulting from your research
  - open data: anyone can access the raw data from your research (with anonymity devices in place for participants)
  - open research: data is publicly released as you receive it for collaboration between specialists and honesty checking
  - open-source tools: proprietary software (SPSS et. al.) can be neither guaranteed accurate/safe nor improved, seek alternatives (R, GNU PSSP et. al.)

## Dismissing obvious concerns

### "But sometimes science is dangerous!"

  - this already happens
  - results in conversations with funding sources
  - often decide to make research private for some organization (NGO/government) that can handle the danger
  - [DÃ¼rrenmatt _Die Physiker_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Physicists)

### "But how does anyone get paid?"

  - for research? grants
  - for food? universities
  - for publishers? who cares
<span style="font-size: 200%;">ðŸ’©</span>
  - in fact, research effectively works like this anyway, except publishers end up making lots
  - the shift is on researchers to fund publication and review; the former is much cheaper nowadays

### "But how do we know what's reputable?"

  - Peer review isn't gone and actually plays a bigger part, which is good.
  - endorsement
  - statistics on individual papers, citation count etc.
  - individual scientists' reputation means more and can be web-encoded
  - are today's journals an accurate measure of reputation?
  - perceived reputation

### "Culture can't change!"

  - it already has

  - many groups serve to benefit
  - example: open-source software movement
  - there is now government pressure

## How

  - [EU FOSTER Program](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/)
  - [Mantra Research Data Management Training](http://datalib.edina.ac.uk/mantra/)
  - **[COS OSF Reproducibility project](https://osf.io/ezcuj/wiki/home)**

## How an open journal looks/works

  - **[PLOS fees](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/s/publication-fees)**
  - [PLOS Computational Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/)
  - COS sponsors: [**many groups**](https://cos.io/about_sponsors/) have incentive to promote open science

## Projects benefiting from open science

_if we have time_

  - [Rescience](http://rescience.github.io/read/), reproducing results from other journals as open-research with open-source toolchains and liberal licensing
    - potential for science students to do their practice research in replication before designing their own studies
    - potential for all researchers to do their _replication homework_
  - [MIRI](http://intelligence.org)
